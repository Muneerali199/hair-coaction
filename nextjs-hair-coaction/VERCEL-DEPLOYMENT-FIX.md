# ✅ Vercel Deployment Errors Fixed!

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### ESLint Errors - Unescaped Entities

All apostrophes in JSX have been properly escaped with `&apos;`:

1. **app/dashboard/page.tsx** (Line 205)
   - ❌ `Here's your dashboard`
   - ✅ `Here&apos;s your dashboard`

2. **app/error.tsx** (Line 25)
   - ❌ `We're sorry`
   - ✅ `We&apos;re sorry`

3. **app/login/page.tsx** (Line 169)
   - ❌ `Don't have an account?`
   - ✅ `Don&apos;t have an account?`

4. **components/LandingPage.tsx** (Line 247)
   - ❌ `world's leading platform`
   - ✅ `world&apos;s leading platform`
