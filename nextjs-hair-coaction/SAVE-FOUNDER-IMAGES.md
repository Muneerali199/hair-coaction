# 📸 Save Founder Images - Quick Guide

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

### **Step 1: Locate Your Images**
The two founder images you uploaded are currently in your session. You need to save them to your project.

### **Step 2: Save Images**

**Option A: Manual Save (Recommended)**
1. Right-click on **Image 1** (first founder image from the chat)
2. Choose "Save Image As..."
3. Navigate to: `nextjs-hair-coaction/public/images/founders/`
4. Save as: **`founder-1.jpg`**

5. Right-click on **Image 2** (second founder image from the chat)
6. Choose "Save Image As..."
7. Navigate to: `nextjs-hair-coaction/public/images/founders/`
8. Save as: **`founder-2.jpg`**

**Option B: Copy from your source**
If you have the original images:
```bash
# Copy from wherever they are to the project folder
cp path/to/first-image.jpg public/images/founders/founder-1.jpg
cp path/to/second-image.jpg public/images/founders/founder-2.jpg
```

### **Step 3: Verify Images**
Check that your folder structure looks like this:
```
nextjs-hair-coaction/
└── public/
    └── images/
        └── founders/
            ├── founder-1.jpg  ✅
            ├── founder-2.jpg  ✅
            └── README.md
```

### **Step 4: Test**
1. Run your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Go to http://localhost:3001

3. Scroll down to the **"Meet Our Founders"** section

4. Your founder images should now be displayed! 🎉

## 🎨 Image Optimization Tips

### **Recommended Specs:**
- **Format**: JPG (smaller file size)
- **Dimensions**: 400x400px or 600x600px (square)
- **File Size**: Under 200KB
- **Quality**: 85-90%

### **Optional: Optimize Images**
If images are too large, you can optimize them:

**Using Online Tools:**
- https://tinypng.com
- https://squoosh.app
- https://compressor.io

**Using Command Line (if you have ImageMagick):**
```bash
cd public/images/founders
magick founder-1.jpg -resize 600x600 -quality 85 founder-1.jpg
magick founder-2.jpg -resize 600x600 -quality 85 founder-2.jpg
```

## ✅ What's Already Done

- ✅ Folder structure created
- ✅ Landing page updated to use local images
- ✅ Image paths configured: `/images/founders/founder-1.jpg` and `/images/founders/founder-2.jpg`

## 🚀 After Saving Images

Once images are saved:

1. **Commit Changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add founder images"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   - Vercel will automatically deploy
   - Your founder images will be live!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Images not showing?**
1. Check file names are exactly: `founder-1.jpg` and `founder-2.jpg`
2. Check images are in: `public/images/founders/`
3. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
4. Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next` then restart dev server

**Images too large?**
- Resize to 600x600px
- Compress with TinyPNG
- Convert to JPG if PNG

**Need different aspect ratio?**
Current setup expects square images. If your images aren't square:
- Crop to square in image editor
- Or modify the component to use object-fit
